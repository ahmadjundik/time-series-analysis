# 📈 Time Series Analysis Project
---

## 📌 Project Overview
Time series analysis is widely applied in finance, economics, weather forecasting, and many other domains.  
In this project, we conducted an analysis on a given dataset to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns, and applied various forecasting models.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The following steps were performed:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and formatting
   - Splitting into training and testing sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Plotting time series data
   - Identifying trend and seasonality
   - Stationarity check (ADF Test, rolling mean/variance)

3. **Forecasting Models**
   - Moving Average
   - Exponential Smoothing
   - ARIMA / SARIMA
   - (Optional) Machine Learning models

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics used: MSE, RMSE, MAPE
   - Comparing accuracy of different models

## 🏆 Results
- Best-performing model: **[Fill here: e.g., ARIMA(2,1,2)]**  
- Achieved lowest RMSE compared to other models.  
- Forecasting results captured trend and seasonality of the dataset effectively.
